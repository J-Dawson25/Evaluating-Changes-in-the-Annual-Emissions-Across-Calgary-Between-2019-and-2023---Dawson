# Evaluating-Changes-in-the-Annual-Emissions-Across-Calgary-Between-2019-and-2023---Jessamyn-Dawson
## Project Overview
This project analysed the changed in the emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide (SO2), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) across Calgary, Alberta between 2019 and 2023. Emissions data for each pollutant from the Government of Canada's Open Government portal was filtered to only include emissions for Calgary, Alberta and duplicate entries were removed. The emissions data was for each pollutant were interpolated for each year (2019-2023) and then clipped to the City of Calgary boundary. The boundaries for each community in Calgary were then overlayed onto each interpolation to show what the emissions were for each community. These five pollutants were included in this analysis because high concentrations of these pollutants are known to have a significant influence on the health of both humans and the environment.
